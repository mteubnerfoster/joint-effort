        <p class="strainFont font-italic sativaInfo">While not all sativa marijuana strains will energize you, most consumers notice a tendency for sativas to produce a “head high,” an uplifting, stimulating effect. They also often report sativas as being helpful in mitigating stress or anxiety, and many consumers enjoy sativas to sharpen focus and boost creativity/motivation.</p>
        <p class="strainFont font-italic mb-0 sativaFx">Common effects associated with sativa strains include feeling happy, uplifting, euphoric, and energetic. Sativas are often thought of as “daytime” strains, used for feeling productive, creative, and focused, and for getting chores done.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="indica" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="profile-tab" class="tab-pane fade px-4 py-5">
        <p class="strainFont font-italic indicaInfo">Not all indica strains will put you “in da couch,” but nevertheless, many consumers associate indicas with full-body effects, for example, heavy limbs or a tingly face. They also report indicas as being helpful in aiding relaxation and curbing insomnia.</p>
        <p class="strainFont font-italic mb-0 indicaFx">Common effects associated with indica strains include feeling relaxed, euphoric, happy, and sleepy. Indicas are commonly known as “nighttime” strains, used for relaxing and unwinding at the end of the night.</p>

      <div id="hybrid" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="contact-tab" class="tab-pane fade px-4 py-5">
        <p class="strainFont font-italic hybridinfo">Hybrid strains are bred from both indica- and sativa-descended plants. Due to the long history of crossbreeding cannabis strains—much of it was historically done underground to evade authorities—strains that have pure indica or pure sativa lineages are rare. Most strains referred to as “indica” or “sativa” are, in fact, hybrids, with genetics inherited from both subspecies.</p>
        <p class="strainFont font-italic mb-0 hybridFX">Since hybrid weed strains derive genetics from indicas and sativas, their ensuing effects can also pull from both indica and sativa strains. Common effects include happy, euphoric, uplifting, energetic, relaxing—it all depends on which hybrid you consume and what effects its “parent” strains are known to produce.</p>
