## About
This app assists users in choosing a cannabis dispensary and a food truck near one another so that they can pick up both in a fast and efficient manner.

## User Story
```
AS someone who enjoys both cannabis and food
I WANT to find a dispensary and a food truck near one another
SO THAT I can order food and cannabis and pick them up for an enjoyable evening at home

WHEN I choose a cannabis type, and
WHEN I choose a food type and click 'SUBMIT',
THEN I see a list of five restaurant and dispensary combinations
WHEN I click on one of the five choices
THEN I am given a map showing me where the restaurant and dispensary are in relation to each other
WHEN I sign up to be a member
THEN my searches are kept in the search history
WHEN I click on my search history
THEN I can go back to a previous search
```
